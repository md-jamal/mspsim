Two Methods of how this runs:

First Method:

	GenericNode calls the cpuloop.loop() method
			|
			|
			\
	That will call run() method which runs in a while loop 
			|
			|
			\
	Calls emulateOp which will emulate opcode one by one and depending on the opcode it performs the operation


Second Method:
	
	GenericNode calls cpu.stepInstructions() which will perform emulateOp function
	call each time we press the step on the ui
